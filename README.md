This is the base of the backend for the website, it is currently being worked on and is not finished.

You can contribute code via pull requests, I will look at the code you are interested in adding and
will test it to make sure it works. Then it will be added to the testing branch for me to add to
the main branch.

## Credits

You must give me (KaboomB52) the credit for the part of which I made, It can be used for private / public use either but you must give me credit either way.
